                <strong>Look at "Molecular Mimicry":</strong> This shows which safe molecules the toxic ones copy! When a toxic molecule has a similar size and shape to a safe molecule, it can trick body proteins into grabbing it. Example: CO (28 g/mol, linear) tricks blood proteins because it looks like O₂ (32 g/mol, linear). The proteins can't tell the difference!
